# Welcome
Welcome to my notes and small tools archive for the Sega Mega CD game Seima Densetsu 3x3 Eyes (聖魔伝説 サザンアイズ). The game is an quite ambitious RPG made by Sega themselves, based on a manga by Yuzo Takada (高田裕三). It has lots of Sega in-jokes and references, an interesting setting and more adult themes - which make it worth investigating in my opinion! A future goal would be a full translation, but this would require quite a bit of teamwork.
